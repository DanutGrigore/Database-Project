This file contains a summary description of my project.
So, this project was carried out on the university server, as it constituted a part of the grade for the "Database" discipline, so it was necessary to work on that server.
The economic theme of my project revolves around the financial situation of football teams in the first league of the Romanian championship. The database I have created encompasses all the teams participating in the domestic competition, providing data about them, both financial (total value per team or per individual player, salaries, etc.) and historical data (founding date, number of trophies won). The aim of this project is to track the situation of the teams, to observe the average salary of each team, the salary budget of each team, market values of their players, as well as their individual performances, along with other aspects.
I chose to do such a project, because it combines the notions of databases and economics with football aspects, and it was much easier for me to create the database.
My database contains 8 tables: 
1. Teams 
2. Cities
3. Team Components
4. Components' functions
5. Players Information
6. Agents
7. Players Positions (On the field)
8. Transfers

I created a separate table with information about players, because they have other characteristics compared to managers and coaches. 
Unfortunately, the table names as well as their attributes are in Romanian, but you can still translate them and I'll attach the conceptual scheme and the code on other worksheets, so you can understand the links between tables.
